 <p>
  We use GNU Mailman to manage our eMail lists, so there is a web interface you
  may use to

  <a href="http://lists.pdxlinux.org/">subscribe, unsubscribe, or manage your account</a>

  there.  In order to post to a list, one simply sends eMail to
  <tt><i>listname</i>@lists.pdxlinux.org</tt>.  The mail must be sent from a
  subscribed list member's eMail address for it to be automatically posted to a
  list.  <em>If you are not subscribed, it will hold your message, awaiting the
  listmaster's approval.</em> To get around this restriction, <b>you may
  subscribe more than one eMail address</b> if you like, and <b>then use the
  account management interface to set one or more of them to non-delivery
  mode</b>.  This way, you will be allowed to post from multiple addresses, but
  will only get list mail sent to one of them.  Other than the subscribed-members
  only restriction, the messages are not censored or screened by human eyes
  before they are broadcast to all subscribers and permanently stored in the
  archive.  However, they are scanned by a virus and UCE (Unsolicited Commercial
  Email, aka "Spam", cf. Monty Python) detector, and hopefully rejected if they
  contain anything evil.
 </p>

 <p>
  The eMail discussion list archives are accessible to the public &mdash; there
  is an

  <a href="http://lists.pdxlinux.org/lurker/">eMail Archive browse and search</a>

  interface online.  It will also allow you to reply to messages there by
  clicking a link, provided your web browser is configured to allow it.  The same
  rules pertaining to posting by subscribed members only still apply, of course.
  <strong>Feel free to comment even if you are not a member</strong> &mdash;
  provided you are on-topic, the message will likely be allowed to post.
 </p>

 <h1>Internet Relay Chat channel</h1>

 <p>
  If you point your favorite IRC client at <tt>irc.freenode.net</tt>, you'll find
  many many channels where <em>Logiciel libre</em> users and developers gather to
  discuss programming and systems administration issues.  Some folks from PLUG
  have formed a channel there, called

  <tt><a href="http://orlug.borked.us/">#orlug</a></tt>.

  Feel free to join us anytime you like!
 </p>

 <h1>Jabber Instant Messaging</h1>

 <p>
  PLUG members may connect to "jabber.pdxlinux.org" with a jabber
  client.  We do not presently have a jabber directory, and the few of
  us on there now are unchecking the "register with server" box in
  Gaim.
 </p>

 <span class="important">Todo: anyone know how to set one up?</span>

 <p>
  Your username there will be "yourname@jabber.pdxlinux.org".  Though it looks
  like an email address, it is really not one, so don't try to send eMail there.
  Please try to use the same username that you use for your primary PLUG list
  subscription eMail address.  This will make it a lot easier for others to find
  you via <tt>jabber.pdxlinux.org</tt>, which is kind of the point, isn't it?
 </p>

 <h1>Other Oregon Linux Groups</h1>

 <p>
  Todo - write me.

<%method ABSTRACT>
<p>
 There are several ways that PLUG members may communicate with one another, both
 asynchronously and synchronously.  Each method has it's unique features and
 benefits.  Some are public forums, and others are for private messages between
 two individuals.  Please keep in mind that, just as in "real life" face to face
 conversation, it is

 <a href="http://www.pdxlinux.org/doc/RFC/for-your-information/rfc1855.txt.gz">imortant to be polite</a>

 to your fellow netizens!
