 <h4>1. What is Linux?</h4>
 <p>
  Linux is an operating system kernel initially created in 1991 by
  Linus Torvalds (then a graduate student at the University of
  Helsinki in Finland). An operating system kernel acts as mediator
  for your programs (processes) and for your hardware. It takes care
  of memory management for all running processes, giving them access
  to processor cycles. The kernel also provides a standardized
  interface for processes to talk to your hardware.
 </p>
 <p>
  To be fully useful in a modern computer system, a kernel typically
  requires the support of other software, such as libraries,
  compilers, editors and shells.  One source of such software is the

  <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation (FSF)</a>

that since 1983 has been working on the GNU Project, an effort to
create a totally free operating system.  When we speak of free
software, we refer to freedom rather than price.  Some free software
actually costs money to acquire, but it always provides the
recipient with important freedoms in how they can use, modify and
share the software.
</p>
<p>
As Linus's kernel started to circulate, people began to collect
all of the useful free software into a complete operating system.
Such collections are called "distributions", and today come in many
flavors: RedHat, Debian, Mandrake, Suse, etc.  You can even
construct your own from suitable parts.  You will see the complete
operating system referred to by various names, sometimes simply as
"Linux", sometimes "GNU/Linux".  The FSF might call the operating
system simply "GNU", as it has largely fulfilled the GNU Project's
original goals.  What you choose to call it is not as important as
recognizing the important freedoms that a complete free software
operating system provides, nor as important as recognizing the
contributions, simultaneously generous and immense, of the kernel
authors, the GNU Project and all the myriad other projects, small
and large that have made the system as useful as it is today.

 <!-- p>
  In 1991, Linus combined the Linus kernel with the GNU System and finally the
  world had a 100%

  <a href="http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free</a> (Libre)
  
  operating system.  Both the GNU System and the Linux kernel were released
  under the GNU General Public License (usually called the GPL). The GPL is a
  &quot;free&quot; software license; this means free in the sense of liberty
  (Frech <em>libre</em>) not in the sense of price (think free speech not free
  beer). It gives you the freedom to &quot;copy, distribute, study, change, and
  improve the software&quot;.
 </p>

 <p>
  <em>Although PLUG has chosen to refer to the GNU/Linux operating system by
   the commonly accepted naming convention of Linux, we honor the fundamentally
   important work that GNU has contributed.</em -->

 <a name="why"></a>
 <h4>2. Why should I run Linux?</h4>

 <p>
  There are many reasons to run Linux many of which you will discover as you
  use it, but some of the most important reasons to run Linux are because it is
  free, relatively secure, cost-effective, and fun.
 </p>

 <ul>
  <li>
   Linux is free meaning that you have the freedom to &quot;copy, distribute,
   study, change and improve the software&quot;.
  </li>
  <li>
   Linux is relatively secure, in part, because user-space is separate from the
   kernel preventing malicious code (e.g., a virus) from damaging the kernel.
  </li>
  <li>
   Linux is stable often running for months, or even years, at a time without
   crashing.
  </li>
  <li>
   Linux is fun because once you get through the initial learning curve you
   will realize how much fun it can be to have almost total control over your
   system.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  While Linux is making inroads on the desktop and has attractive windowing
  systems available, its primary claim to fame is as a server OS. Linux --
  running the Apache web server software -- is the most popular OS for web
  servers. Check out

  <a href="http://www.netcraft.com/">Netcraft</a>

  to learn more about web servers currently serving the Web.
 </p>
 <div align="center"><a href="#top">[Back to top]</a></div>

 <a name="where"></a> 
 <h4><b>3. Where can I get Linux?</b></h4>

 <p>
  Although Linux is free, most users purchase a distribution whereby a
  distribution company bundles the Linux kernel, GNU software, other software,
  documentation, etc., together to form a distribution. You can purchase a
  distribution CD at most computer stores or you can download it for free from
  most distribution company's Web sites. There are a number of distributions,
  including, amoung the more popular,

  <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a>,

  <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</a>

  and

  <a href="http://www.linux-mandrake.com/">Mandrake</a>.

  There is a more comprehensive list of distributions in our local

  <a href="/resources/distributions.html">Linux distributions list</a>.

 <a name="plug"></a> 
 <h4>4. What is the Portland Linux UNIX Group (PLUG)?</h4>

 <p>
  We are a community of Linux and UNIX enthusiasts dedicated to teaching and
  learning about Linux and UNIX. Whether you are a novice or an expert, we
  welcome you to participate in our e-mail discussion list and to in our
  meetings and events. We don't have a formal membership process or membership
  dues.
 </p>
 <div align="center"> <p><a href="#top">[Back to top]</a></div>

 <a name="meetings"></a>
 <h4>5. When and where are your meetings?</h4>

 <p>
  We hold meetings at 7:00 PM on the first Thursday of every month in 
  Room 296/298, Smith Memorial Center,

  <a href="http://www.pdx.edu/">Portland State University.</a>
 </p>

 <p>
  Meetings usually include a few minutes of group business, followed by a
  speaker. The speaker normally presents for about one-half hour followed by a
  question and answer session. The speakers are usually experts in some topic
  of interest to Linux users (e.g., security). If you want to learn about
  Linux, we highly recommend you attend these meetings. We announce the
  meetings to <i>plug</i> and <i>plug-announce</i> several days in advance.
 </p>

 <p>
  After the official meeting some people go to the

  <a href="http://www.luckylab.com/">Lucky Labrador</a>

  pub for micro-brew beer and conversation.
 </p>
 <div align="center"><a href="#top">[Back to top]</a></div>

 <a name="list"></a> 
 <h4>6. What are the <i>plug</i> and <i>plug-announce</i> e-mail lists and how do I join?</h4>

 <p>
  Through the <i>plug</i> e-mail list we help each other make better use of
  Linux at home and at work. If you are interested in learning more about Linux
  we recommend that you subscribe to the e-mail discussion list. Please note
  that the <i>plug</i> list includes a lot of discussion hence a large volume
  of e-mail. If you just want to receive just announcements of meetings and
  other events, then join the <i>plug-announce </i>e-mail list. Please go to

  <a href="http://lists.pdxlinux.org/">http://lists.pdxlinux.org/</a>

  to subscribe to or unsubscribe from either list.
 </p>
 <div align="center"><a href="#top">[Back to top]</a></div>

 <a name="otherlists"></a>
 <h4>7. What other e-mail lists does PLUG host?</h4>

 <p>
  We have a number of other e-mail lists covering a variety of topics. Please
  go to

  <a href="http://lists.pdxlinux.org/">http://lists.pdxlinux.org/</a>

  for a complete list and to subscribe to or unsubscribe from any of our e-mail
  lists.
 </p>
 <div align="center"><a href="#top">[Back to top]</a></div>

 <a name="archives"></a>
 <h4>8. How can I search the <em>plug</em> e-mail list archives?</h4>

 <p>
  If you have a question about Linux, changes are good that PLUG members 
  have answered it. Go to

  <a href="http://lists.pdxlinux.org/lurker/">http://lists.pdxlinux.org/lurker/</a>

  for archived emails back to the beginning of 2002.
  <!-- Unfortunately, the search engine on the the PLUG website is broken. You can
  still search for older postings at

  <a href="http://plug.skylab.org/">http://plug.skylab.org/</a>

  for old ones that should soon be imported into the new archive machinery. #### Todo -->

 <a name="clinic"></a>
 <h4>9. What is the PLUG Linux Clinic?</h4>

 <p>
  The PLUG Linux Clinic provides an opportunity for you to get hands-on help
  with your system. If you are more experienced, it provides you an opportunity
  to help others with their systems. Those needing help can bring their systems
  to the clinic.
 </p>

 <p>
  We hold the clinics on the <em>third</em> Sunday of the month at
  <a href="http://www.freegeek.org/map.php">Free Geek</a>.
  The coordinator of this event usually sends an announcement to 
  <em>plug</em> and <em>plug-announce</em> during the week
  prior to the clinic.
 </p>
 <div align="center"><a href="#top">[Back to top]</a></div>

 <a name="k-12"></a>
 <h4>10. What is PLUG for Education?</h4>

 <p>
  <em>PLUG for Education</em> is an effort by PLUG members to assist K-12
  schools in implementing Linux servers and workstations. Monthly events
  usually coincide with the <em>Portland Linux Clinic</em>. Please see the

  <a href="http://www.riverdale.k12.or.us/linux/"">PLUG for Education</a>

  Web site for more information.

 <a name="munging"</a>
 <h4>11.Why are all of email addresses on the PLUG web site in this odd format?  How do I convert them to a useable address?</h4>

 <p>
  Due to the abuse of email commonly known as spamming, the Webmaster has
  performed a simple form of munging to every email address on this website. So
  far, no one has complained about this step, so the Webmaster will continue
  this policy until either someone does complain, or he is replaced.
 </p>

 <!--
 <p>
  Some people are under the impression that if the Webmaster is presented with
  pairs of hands chopped off of 100 spammers, he will unmunge all of the email
  addresses on the website. While the Webmaster has never stated this, he is
  willing to accept a gift like this to see if it might convince him to change
  his policy.
 </p>
 -->

 <p>
  A useable email address may be created from the munged one by substituting
  "&nbsp;AT&nbsp;" with "&#064;", and "&nbsp;DOT&nbsp;" with ".". 
 </p>

 <h4>12. Who hosts PLUG's Web site and e-mail lists?</h4>

 <p>
  <!-- a href="http://www.microsharp.com/">Micro Sharp</a -->
  <a href="http://nakedape.cc/">Naked Ape Consulting</a>

  has been kind enough to host both PLUG's Web site and e-mail lists. A big thank you
