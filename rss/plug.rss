Of course I will open-source the card design and put it on my website. 
But at a nickel a piece, it is a lot easier to have them printed.

Can I put you down for 5 for a quarter?  :-)

<title>"slinkymax0r" &lt;slinkywizard@integraonline.com>: Re: [PLUG] RAID for remote filesystems</title>
<link></link>
<description>&lt;pre>&gt; Does anyone know if it's possible to RAID remote filesystems? I'm thinking
&gt; of being able to combine multiple sshfs or gmailfs filesystems into one
&gt; mount point.

RAID is a block level or byte level technology... not a file level one. 
You could certainly mirror data between two systems, but it sounds like
you're more looking into representing multiple mount points as a single
name space.

Max

as Linux Today and BlueOregon:

http://www.news4neighbors.net/article.pl?sid=05/10/03/195242

Describes the trip down to OSU's open source labs while covering a
variety of related issues from HB 2892, to the Bus Project and POSSE.

<description>&lt;pre>Since your filesystem needs to be laid on TOP of a block-level device,
you can't really do what you're looking to... the closest
approximation would be using a cluster filesystem that takes into
account some underlying fabric connecting a bunch of block devices
(Lustre, PVFS, GFS, etc)...

Though it would likely be possible to hack together a bunch of network
block devices mounted locally and do this.  I'm not sure about your
sshfs or gmailfs filesystems, I'm guessing they won't enable you to do
that however.  Perhaps if you could kludge a sparse file as a block
device (cryptoloop or somesuch) accessed OVER these and mounted
locally you could do it?  If you're accessing these over commodity
internet with so many layers of abstraction, it's unlikely to be
usable or stable however :)

<title>Galen Seitz &lt;galens@seitzassoc.com>: [PLUG] fedora core 4 and Intel wireless 2200BG constant arp traffic</title>
<link></link>
<description>&lt;pre>
The wireless indicator on my laptop has been flashing for no apparent
reason, so I ran tcpdump.  It seems to be sending out arp requests every
2 seconds or so.  My network only uses 192.168.1.x.  My google searches for
192.168.30.32 have only brought up references to Cisco equipment.  Any
ideas what might be generating this traffic?

09:52:23.745963 arp who-has 192.168.30.32 (Broadcast) tell 192.168.30.32
09:52:25.849095 arp who-has 192.168.30.32 (Broadcast) tell 192.168.30.32
09:52:27.883470 arp who-has 192.168.30.32 (Broadcast) tell 192.168.30.32
09:52:29.936135 arp who-has 192.168.30.32 (Broadcast) tell 192.168.30.32
09:52:32.010254 arp who-has 192.168.30.32 (Broadcast) tell 192.168.30.32
09:52:34.063133 arp who-has 192.168.30.32 (Broadcast) tell 192.168.30.32

The laptop is a Thinkpad X40 with an Intel 2200BG wireless card,
and Fedora core 4, and the kernel version is 2.6.12.1456_FC4.

thanks,
galen

&gt; I'm trying to build some cross tools for the AVR microcontrollers,

&gt; build cross versions of binutils, gcc, and gdb, the info files that 
&gt; get created have the same name and path as the corresponding files 
&gt; for the native host tools.  In order to eliminate the conflict, I'd 
&gt; like to do something like the following in my spec file:
&gt;
&gt; %define _infodir %{_infodir}/avr

Generally, I'd just a) specify your longer path throughout the spec 
file or b) define _infodir with a macro further up the chain or with a 
full pathname

a) When building and installing, specify --infodir=%{_infodir}/avr,
    and include that path in your %files section.

b) %define _infodir %{_datadir}/info/avr

    or

    %define _infodir /usr/share/info/avr
