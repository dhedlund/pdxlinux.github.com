 <h1>General Meeting Information</h1>

 <p>
  Our general meetings are <i>usually</i> held at 7:00 PM on the first Thursday of
  every month, <!-- however for our next meeting we will be changing our usual 
  time --> unless the first Thursday falls on a major holiday. 
  Our meetings are generally held in Room FAB 86-01 of 
  The Fariborz Maseeh College of Engineering
  and Computer Science Building at Portland State University.  This room
  is hidden away in the basement; but go into the Fariborz Maseeh 
  College of Engineering building, go to down stairs to the basement and 
  wonder around the halls and you will find it.  If you are really having 
  trouble call David Mandel on his cell phone at 541-730-5285.  Our meetings
  are almost always in this location, but check a few days before a meeting
  as we do need to change meeting locations once in a while.
  The Fariborz Maseeh College of Engineering
  and Computer Science Building 
  (also nick named The New Engineering Building)
  is on SW 4th across from SW College Street.
  (See location H-10 on the map at http://pdxLinux.org/campus_map.jpg )

                     Free Content and the Data Revolution
                                      by

     The amount of information available on the Internet has 
     exploded in recent years and shows no sign of slowing down.  
     Most of this information is freely available to anyone with 
     a web browser --- but what does free mean?  Daniel Hedlund 
     will lead a discussion on the meaning of open data and explore 
     how the open source movement is no longer constrained to the 
     realm of software.

  the New Engineering Building at Portland State University.

  link to here, please contact the webmaster &#60;geoff AT pdxlinux DOT org&#62;
  so that they can be added!
