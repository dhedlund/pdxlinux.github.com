 <h1>Web page news</h1>

 <!-- p>
  This will be here soon...  Each news item will be a separate file,
  named like "YYYY.MM.DD.NNN.html".  Each of them will start with a
  DOCTYPE div (HTML 4.01 Transitional), and the contents of that DIV
  will be displayed...  Well let's think this over.
 </p>

 <p>
  <b>Coming soon!</b> An easy to maintain NEWS feature, to a PLUG
  website near you.
 </p -->

<p><em>17 January 2003</em> After some difficulties, we have recovered the original
content of this site. Discussion is underway concerning reversion of the new format.
<p><em>30 July 2002</em> David Mandel has contributed a <a href="articles/plug-history.html">Short History of PLUG.</a>
<p><em>20 July 2002</em> Karl Hegbloom, sysadmin for Drizzle, the server PLUG's web page lives
on, added a <a href="http://old.pdxlinux.org/index.php/resources/drizzle_resources">collection
of web-accessible documentation.</a> (<em>Note:</em> this is the old web page, and not all links on that page work.)

<p><em>16 July 2002</em> At the request of Zot O'Connor, information about the 
Linux Advanced Topics Talk was added to the web site.
<p><em>18 June 2002</em> Geoff Burling revised the content of the main page, and the first
Resources page, as well as added more meeting information.

<p><em>22 May 2002</em> Wil added a link to the #orlug IRC channel home page.

<p><em>8 May 2002</em> Wil Cooley re-implemented the site using a very simple, home-brewed PHP template system.</p>

<p><em>28 March 2001</em> Comment page added.

<p><em>7 January 2001</em> Daniel Hedlund (who created much of the webpage design)
created a mailing list to discuss topics/opinions/comments relating to the PLUG website.
