   VectorSection uses concepts such as "small pieces, loosely joined" to 
   inform the design of a set of transparent and simple-yet-capable 
   interconnected tools for manipulating and translating 2D and 3D vector 
   graphics data between multiple common and uncommon file formats. Learning 
   how this system is put together has applications not just to vector 
   graphics, but to data translation/migration in general.
   </p><p>
   This presentation will cover the basics of CAD/vector graphics 
   interoperability issues and details about how VectorSection allows for 
   ad-hoc extension in any programming or scripting language.
   </p><p>
   Note: We have been told that CNN is in town doing a story on Open 
   Source Software in Portland. Maybe they will come to our meeting. Better 
   yet, they should go to the Lucky Lab after the meeting.
