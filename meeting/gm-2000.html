  April, 2000. Linux Clusters by Chuck Morrison &#060;cmorrison AT
  valinux DOT com&#062;<br/>

  Chuck is coming from Colorado to give this talk.  He is an engineer
  with VA Linux specializing in Linux cluster technology.  We are
  fortunate to get him.
 </p>

 <p>
  He didn't say too much about his talk, except that it will be aimed
  at the hardware side of clustering and won't be about programming
  techniques for Linux clusters.

  May, 2000. Enterprise Management Open Source Solutions to
  Proprietary Problems by Shane O'Donnell &#060;shane AT www DOT
  opennms DOT org&#062;</br>

  <em>Prerequisites</em> Attendees are expected to understand basic
  data networking concepts, basic network management concepts, and
  relate to the problem of managing networks.
 </p>

 <p>
  <em>Description</em> We discuss the effect of the open source
  revolution on network/systems management and compare technology in
  commercial platforms to open source alternatives.  Emphasis is on
  the four value cornerstones of open source network management;
  speed, price, customizability and technology.
 </p>

 <p>
  <em>Demonstration of OpenNMS.org software</em> There will be a 30-45
  minutes demonstration of the software.  (This assumes that David
  Mandel is able to get the equipment.)
 </p>

 <p>
  <em>Biography</em> Shane speaks regularly on network management and
  business topics at international user group and industry
  events. Shane's recent focus is on leveraging Open Source tools in
  network management and building the Open Source developer community
  at OpenNMS.org.

  September, 2000. Webmin by David Mandel &#060;dmandel AT transport
  DOT com&#062;</br>

  Webmin is a system administration tool for numerous Linux
  distributions, FreeBSD, and Solaris.  It is web based, highly
  configurable, and designed to be extensible.  All of this makes
  webmin an excellent tool for specialized Linux boxes such as
  internet appliances.
 </p>

 <p>
  Webmin is fairly simple, and this presentation will reflect 
  this simplicity.  Don't expect high powered computing.
 </p>

  Instead, we will:
 <ul>
  <li>display the webmin menus</li>
  <li>look at the structure of webmin</li>
  <li>discuss how to customize webmin</li>
  <li>discuss how to extend webmin</li>
  <li>discuss applications for webmin</li>
  <li>discuss the current status of webmin, including bugs and weaknesses</li>
 </ul>

  Python, and portable to most Linux/Unix distributions. He said

  December, 2000. WireX's Immunix Linux distro by Greg Kroah
  &#060;greg AT wirex DOT com&#062;</br>

  Greg Kroah of Wirex will talk about Wirex's Linux Immunix
  distribution, Immunix.  This is a modified Red Hat distribution
  aimed at the internet appliance market.  Among other things, Wirex
  has added security features to their distribution.  For example,
  they have recompliled all the code using a modified C compiler that
  prevents buffer overflows.
