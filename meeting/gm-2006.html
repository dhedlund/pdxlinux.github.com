   <b>Presentation:</b>Open Source Software in Education especially <i>moodle</i>
   <br><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><font size="-1">by

   </p><p>
   <a href="http://www.moodle.org">Moodle</a> is a course management system 
   (CMS) - a free, Open Source software package designed using sound 
   pedagogical principles, to help educators create effective 
   online learning communities.  You can download and use it 
   on any computer you have handy (including webhosts), yet it 
   can scale from a single-teacher site to a 50,000-student University. 
   </p><p>
   Dan Carrere has worked with Linux and other Open Source Software 
   for many years.  He has also taught and worked at several 
   post secondary institutions.  He is currently working at
   Lane Community College where he has been active in building 
   a Moodle site.

   <b>Presentation:</b>VectorSection (previously known as UberConverter) an
   Open Source File Format Translation for CAD and Vector Graphics
   <br><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><font size="-1">by
   Eric Wilhelm &#60;<tt>scratchcomputing AT gmail DOT com</tt>&#62;
   </a></i></font></span>
   </p><p>
   <a href="http://scratchcomputing.com/projects/vectorsection/">VectorSection</a> 
    uses concepts such as "small pieces, loosely joined" to
   inform the design of a set of transparent and simple-yet-capable
   interconnected tools for manipulating and translating 2D and 3D vector
   graphics data between multiple common and uncommon file formats. Learning
   how this system is put together has applications not just to vector
   graphics, but to data translation/migration in general.
   </p><p>
   This presentation will cover the basics of CAD/vector graphics
   interoperability issues and details about how VectorSection allows for
   ad-hoc extension in any programming or scripting language.
   </p><p>
   Note: We have been told that CNN is in town doing a story on Open
   Source Software in Portland. Maybe they will come to our meeting. Better
   yet, they should go to the Lucky Lab after the meeting.

   <b>Presentation:</b>Rapid Discussions on Any Topic
   <br><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><font size="-1">by
   Everyone and anyone
   </a></i></font></span>
   </p><p>
   Instead of having a formal presentation, we will get together and discuss anything 
   anyone wants to discuss in brief sessions of no more than a few minutes each. If we 
   have enough people involved we can break into smaller groups to handle each topic. 
   David Mandel will provide a structure to make this work and come prepared to discuss 
   one or two of his favorite hacks from Linux Server Hacks. This should get us started.

   TeX is a computer language designed for use in typesetting;
   in particular, for typesetting math and other technical
   material.  Extremely high quality work can be done with
   TeX.  Indeed, this is TeX's niche market.

   Robin is the Executive Director of the Tex Users Group, which is
   the guiding organization for Tex.  She and a colleague will
   describe TeX along with some of it's extensions.

   <b>Presentation:</b>Inkscape
   <br><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><font size="-1">by
   Bryce Harrington &#60;<tt>bryce AT osdl DOT org</tt>&#62;
   </a></i></font></span>
   </p><p>
   Inkscape is an Open Source vector graphics editor, with capabilities
   similar to Illustrator, Freehand, CorelDraw, or Xara X using the
   W3C standard Scalable Vector Graphics  (SVG) file format.
   Supported SVG features include shapes, paths, text, markers,
   clones, alpha blending, transforms, gradients, patterns, and
   grouping. Inkscape also supports Creative Commons meta-data,
   node editing, layers, complex path operations, bitmap tracing,
   text-on-path, flowed text, direct XML editing, and more. It imports
   formats such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and others and exports PNG as
   well as multiple vector-based formats.
</p><p>
   Inkscape's main goal is to create a powerful and convenient drawing
   tool fully compliant with XML, SVG, and CSS standards. We also aim
   to maintain a thriving user and developer community by using open,
    community-oriented development process, and by making sure Inkcape
   is easy to learn, to use, and to extend.

   </p><p>
   Alex is bringing a small group of people from OSU to talk with us about the
   <a href="http://osel.oregonstate.edu/Main_Page">Open Source Education Lab</a>, the
   <a href="http://lug.oregonstate.edu/">Oregon State Linux Users Group</a>, and the Open
   Source Lab.  As many of you know they have a lot of cool projects going on.
   The Open Source Lab at OSU is nationally recognized and is
   home to a number of major Open Source projects.  The
   Open Source Education Lab and the Oregon State Linux Users Group
   are also neat and provide ways of getting undergraduates
   involved with OpenSource software.

   <b>Presentation:</b>Ingres is Open Source
   <br><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><font size="-1">by
   John Murphy &#60;john DOT murphy AT ingres DOT com&#62;
   </a></i></font></span>
   </p><p>
   Ingres is a well known Relational Data Base Management
   System similar to Oracle, DB2, and many others.
   Like Oracle, Ingres has been around for a long time,
   has a significant user base and David Mandel believes
   it has more built-in and/or add-on tools than postgres or mySQL.
</p><p>
   Ingres has been available on Linux for quite some time,
   but Ingres is now Open Source and Ingres Corporation
   is developing an Open Source strategy for Ingres.
</p><p>
   John Murphy will be in town and will tell us more about Ingres.
   He is also hoping to bring an associate to discuss a new
   generation of Ingres where they bundle a Linux distribution
   from rPath as part of Ingres.
