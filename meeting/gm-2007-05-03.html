    Agile methods such as Extreme Programming (XP) rely on a
    readily repeated suite of tests to give developers the courage
    they need to continuously improve their code.

    In this talk XP pioneer Ward Cunningham will dissect the agile
    testing strategy and framework that the Portland Eclipse
    Foundation team created while developing the recently deployed
    MyFoundation Portal, a LAMP application.
    </p><p>
    The testing framework is notable for two reasons. One, it has
    been deployed into production with the application and serves
    as "open and transparent" documentation. Two, it integrates
    with the application in such a way to make it both simple and
    powerful at the small expense of some test coverage.

    Part 3 of Ward's blog series on the portal includes more
    explanation, screen shots, and a link to the
