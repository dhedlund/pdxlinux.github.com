   <p>
     Programmers (and other creative artists) need version control systems to coordinate different 
   contributors' work and to keep track of all the different releases or versions of a project. In 
   recent years, many people in the Open Source community have used Concurrent Version System (cvs) 
   for this. cvs works well, but it has a number of problems and limitations.
</p><p>
   Subversion is a replacement to cvs which has most of cvs's features without some of the problems 
   and limitations of cvs.
