  February, 1999. Construction of an Efficent FTP Server by Zach Brown
  &#060;zab DOT zabbo DOT net&#062;<br/> Zach has been writing a new
  ftp server to replace the standard Linux ftp server. It is very
  efficent and especially good handling services for high traffic ftp
  sites.
 </p>

 <p>
  March, 1999. David Mandel &#060;dmandel DOT transport.com>gives two
  presentations.
 </p>

 <p>
  First Topic: Linux 2.2<br/>

  A number of people expressed an interest in Linux 2.2.  We will
  devote a few minutes to discussing the changes and improvements
  included in this kernel.  I hope someone comes prepared, because I
  have not looked at the new kernel myself.
 </p>

 <p>
  Main Topic: Why Learn GNU-Emacs?<br/>

  GNU-Emacs is much more than "just a program editor".  It has modes
  for Fortran, C, Lisp, HTML, etc.  And if it doesn't have the mode
  you need, it has a programming language for you to write your own
  mode.
 </p>

 <p>
  In this talk David Mandel will discuss some of these modes as well
  as a few emacs subsystems that allow one execute shell commands,
  telnet to other systems, use ftp, and so on.
 </p>

 Please Note:
 <p>
  This talk is a survey of emacs applications.  It is not a detailed
  tutorial telling the new emacs user what keys to type when; and it
  is not for advanced emacs users who will surely know everything in
  the talk already.  Instead, it is a discussion of why you may want
  to invest a good deal of time learning emacs.

 <p>
  October, 1999. SAMBA by Tim Grant &#060;tjg DOT avalongroup DOT
  net&#062;<br/>

  Linux and other Unix boxes are often used as servers for Microsoft
  clients.  Altho this can be done in a number of ways, it is
  generally done using Samba.  Samba is a set of tools which allow
  Linux and other Unix OSs to communicate using MicroSoft's SMB
  protocol.
