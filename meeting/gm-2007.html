   <b>Presentation:</b>Randall Schwartz, Intel, and the Law
   <br><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><font size="-1">by
   Randal L. Schwartz &#60;merlyn AT stonehenge DOT com&#62;
   </a></i></font></span>
   </p><p>
   As most of you know Randal is "the primary person to blame
   for Stonehenge Consulting Services, Inc."  He is author of
   many of the principal books and articles on Perl programming,
   and gives many workshops including workshops with Geek Cruises.
   Randal is also an expert on computer crime both as a consultant
   to law enforcement agencies and as a defendant who became
   a felon for doing his job with a bit too much enthusiasm.
</p><p>
   He will discuss his experiences with
   computer crime and the legal system and what you need to do
   to avoid having similar problems.
   More information about his case can be found at the 
   <a href="http://www.lightlink.com/fors/">Lightlink website</a>.

   Most system users and administrators aren't security experts
   and don't want to be; but they have to deal with security
   in order to get other things done.  And they have to do this
   within very tight budgets for both in terms of time and money.

<b>Presentation:</b>What went wrong with my disaster recovery plan
   <br><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><font size="-1">by

   </p><p>
    Although many organizations have disaster recovery plans, an actual                                 disaster can present a number of unexpected problems. From transportation                           difficulties to incorrect public information to clueless vendors,                                   Brian Martin will share the realities he experienced during an actual                               disaster in the aftermath of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.

<b>Presentation:</b>Disaster Recovery with Linux disk imaging and                    bare-metal restore

   Jerome Boutaud and Stephan Lawton of

   </a></i></font></span>
   </p><p>
   Last month Brian Martin from Martin Consulting discussed his
   personal experience with disaster recovery in a real world
   situation.  This month Jerome Boutaud and Stephan Lawton
   will be discussing and demonstrating the nuts and bolts
   of disaster recovery with different Linux distributions.
   They will also discuss the differences between image-based
   backup and file-based backup, why the distinction is so
   important in the recovery phase of a disaster, and the
   advantages and disadvantages of each.

<b>Presentation:</b>Developer and Customer Focused Tests for a LAMP Environment
   <br><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><font size="-1">by
   Ward Cunningham &#60;ward@c2.com&#62;
   </a></i></font></span>
   </p><p>
    Agile methods such as Extreme Programming (XP) rely on a
    readily repeated suite of tests to give developers the courage
    they need to continuously improve their code.

    In this talk XP pioneer Ward Cunningham will dissect the agile
    testing strategy and framework that the Portland Eclipse
    Foundation team created while developing the recently deployed
    MyFoundation Portal, a LAMP application.
    </p><p>
    The testing framework is notable for two reasons. One, it has
    been deployed into production with the application and serves
    as "open and transparent" documentation. Two, it integrates
    with the application in such a way to make it both simple and
    powerful at the small expense of some test coverage.

    Part 3 of Ward's blog series on the portal includes more
    explanation, screen shots, and a link to the
   <a href="http://dash.eclipse.org/~ward/portal-blog/">live test site</a>

   <a href="http://www.aboutus.org">AboutUs.org</a> which is a wiki about web
   sites. Aboutus.org is quite popular. Some internet rating services put it in

   <b>Presentation:</b>Comments on Personal Telco and Public Wireless Internet in Portland  
   <br><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><font size="-1">by
   Russell Senior &#60;russell AT personaltelco DOT net&#62;
   </a></i></font></span>
   </p><p>
   <a href="htpp://www.personaltelco.net">The Personal Telco Project</a> is             an all volunteer open source oriented organization that has been a leader            in bringing free wireless internet access to Portland for many years.                Personal Telco has brought free wireless access to Portland by working               with coffee shops, bars, and other businesses and individuals who are                willing to share their internet connections. Personal Telco predates                 Portland's Metro-fi system by several years, and judging by Metro-fi's               difficulties it may postdate it as well.

   Russell Senior has been active with Personal Telco since the early days.             He will discuss the current status of Personal Telco and describe its current        projects, as well as Personal Telco's role in the mix of wireless services           in the Portland area.
