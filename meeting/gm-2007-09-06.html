   Ray has started and ran a number of tech businesses starting with Semaphore
   which he started as a student at MIT in 1984 and SnapNames which he co-founded
   in 2000.  Following the success of SnapNames, Ray became interested in wiki
   technology, and has started a number of wikis. The most notable of these is
   <a href="http://www.aboutus.org">AboutUs.org</a> which is a wiki about web
   sites. Aboutus.org is quite popular. Some internet rating services put it in
   the top 2000 sites on the Internet.
