   <p>
Matthew Doggett from the Oregon State University College 
of Oceanography of Atmospheric Sciences has been working  
with Open Source GIS (Geographic Information Systems) packages
for quite some time.  In particular, he has been working 
with Map Server which is an OpenSource development 
environment for constructing spatially enabled Internet-web 
applications.  It was originally developed by the University 
of Minnesota, although it is currently quite popular and 
large development community today.  And of course, it runs  
in a Linux/Apache environment.
