  February, 2001. Linux Terminal Server Project by Paul Nelson and
  Eric Harrison.</br>

  Paul Nelson and I have been working on building a Linux "terminal
  server appliance" distribution. Essentially we are taking Red Hat
  7.0, the Linux Terminal Server Project, and mashing the two together
  in a way that we think the average school tech could implement.
 </p>

 <p>
  Riverdale School District has been testing Linux-based terminals for
  a couple of months now. I believe they currently have 20 in
  production use.
 </p>

 We could talk about:
 <ul>
  <li>Riverdale's experiences</li>
  <li>discuss our design objectives</li>
  <li>show how the LTSP works</li>
  <li>describe the hacks required to RH7 & LTSP to get it all to work</li>
  <li>do a demo of a fresh install (my even do the install there)</li>
  <li>plug in a few random PXE/BOOTP enabled systems (bring your laptop!)</li>
  <li>discuss what is on our TODO list & our wish list</li>
  <li>let people play with the terminals</li>
 </ul>
