  virtual computers, a number of different virtual environments for

  October, 2002, Overview of LVM (Logical Volume Manager) by Cooper
  Stevenson &#060;cooper AT linux-enterprise DOT net&#062;</br>

  Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is a system for handling disks and disk
  partitions.  It enables one to "glue" two or more disks or
  partitions together to form a larger virtual disk which can then be
  logically partitioned and used like a normal disk, only with extra
  features.  For example, one can resize LVM based file systems.
