   <b>Presentation:</b> "Greylisting and a Look at the Anti-Spam Landscape"<br>

   <p>
    Black lists (both automated and not), white lists, keyword/regexp/Bayesian
    filters, SPF, and now "greylisting"-- where will the continuing
    anti-spam arms race take us next? This talk includes an overview of
    current anti-spam techniques with some thoughts on their relative pros
    and cons, and a more in-depth look at the recently available "greylisting"
    technique, which is proving amazingly effective at blocking certain
    classes of spam.
   </p><p>
    Hal Pomeranz is the technical lead and official spam eradicator for
    Deer Run Associates, a small consulting firm (recently relocated to
    Eugene, OR). But this is merely his "mild-mannered secret identity"
    that hides his exploits as a Faculty Member and Senior Unix Instructor
    for the SANS Institute, Technical Advisor for the Center for Internet
    Security, and Technical Editor for Sys Admin Magazine.
