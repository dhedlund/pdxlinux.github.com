  May, 1998. This appears to have been a General Discussion about
  Linux, according to

  <a href="letter14May1998.html">this letter to the PLUG list.</a>

  It als may have been the only meeting where detailed minutes were
  taken.  Nice to have a little history, isn't it?
 </p>

 <p>
  July, 1998. Informal Presentation.<br/>
  
  We decided to bring two or three machines and 
  have smaller discussion groups around these machines.
 </p>

 The following people have offered to bring machines:
 <ul>
  <li>Ward Spangenberg &#060;ward AT unidial DOT com&#062;</li>
  <li>Dennis Young &#060;psu06598 AT odin DOT cc DOT pdx DOT edu&#062;</li>
  <li>Rich Shepard &#060;rshepard AT appl-ecosys DOT com&#062;</li>
  <li>Eric Harrison &#060;harrison AT net25-cust146 DOT pdx DOT wantweb DOT net&#062;</li>
  <li>Aaron Armstrong &#060;aaron AT pcez DOT com&#062;</li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  This gives us enough machines.  Most of them are RedHat, but one
  of them runs S.u.S.E. 5.2.

  August, 1998. The Portland Group on Linux and High Performance Computing<br/>

   The Portland Group is has been producing high performance
   Fortran, C, and C++ compilers since 1989 for a variety
   of platforms.  Their compilers are well respected in the
   industry, and used and resold by companies as such as Intel, 
   Cray Research, Hewlett-Packard, and others.  As Linux and 
   clusters of workstations become more and more important in 
   scientific computing, the Portland Group has responded with 
   products in these areas.<br/>

  September, 1998. Topic To be Announced Later by Eric Harrison &#060;harri AT northwest DOT com&#062;
 </p>

 <p>
  October, 1998. Discussion and Comments on Linux/Windows Integration by David
  Mandel &#060;dmandel AT transport DOT com&#062;<br/>

  He intends to lead a discussion of various topics relevant to
  Linux/Windows.
 </p>

 Topics will include:
 <ol>
  <li>An overview of Unix subsystems for Windows</li>
  <li>An overview of Windows emulators for Linux</li>
  <li>Networking Linux to Windows using:
   <ol>
    <li>A NFS</li>
    <li>samba</li>
    <li>X-emulation and Win terminal packages</li>
    <li>VNC</li>
   </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Integrating the pieces.
   <ul>
    <li>What does this mean for the future?</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
 </ol>

 <p>
  The discussion will be rather informal.  I was hoping to
  have a live demo of some of this (namely samba and vnc), 
  but this seems unlikely at this point.

  November, 1998. Robert Young CEO of Red Hat Linux, and Scott McNeil President S.u.S.E. America.<br/>

  As it happens Robert Young and Scott McNeil will be at Intel Thursday afternoon.
  I have arranged to have both of them come to our PLUG meeting.  They are planning
  short talks followed by a panel discussion at Intel. They will probably do the same
  thing for PLUG.  They are also bringing lots of goodies.

  December, 1998. Discussion and Comments on Linux Security by Zot O'Connor &#060;zot AT ZotConsulting DOT com&#062;
