   Ingres is a well known Relational Data Base Management
   System similar to Oracle, DB2, and many others.
   Like Oracle, Ingres has been around for a long time,
   has a significant user base and David Mandel believes
   it has more built-in and/or add-on tools than postgres or
   mySQL.
</p><p>
   John Murphy will be in town and will tell us more about Ingres.
   He is also hoping to bring an associate to discuss a new
   generation of Ingres where they bundle a Linux distribution
   from rPath as part of Ingres.

   Like Oracle, Ingres has been around for a long time,
   has a significant user base and David Mandel believes
   it has more built-in and/or add-on tools than postgres or mySQL.
</p><p>
   Ingres has been available on Linux for quite some time,
   but Ingres is now Open Source and Ingres Corporation
   is developing an Open Source strategy for Ingres.

   John Murphy will be in town and will tell us more about Ingres.
   He is also hoping to bring an associate to discuss a new
   generation of Ingres where they bundle a Linux distribution
