   many of the principal books and articles on Perl programming,
   and gives many workshops including workshops with Geek Cruises.
   Randal is also an expert on computer crime both as a consultant
   to law enforcement agencies and as a defendant who became
   a felon for doing his job with a bit too much enthusiasm.

   He will discuss his experiences with
   computer crime and the legal system and what you need to do
   to avoid having similar problems.
