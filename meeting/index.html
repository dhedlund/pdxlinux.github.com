  PLUG General Meetings are usually held on the first
  <em>Thursday</em> of every month.  The

  <a href="gm-<% $next_meeting_date %>.html">next meeting</a>
  will be held on <% $next_meeting_date %>.

  We typically email an announcement and the meeting agenda to the
  <em>plug</em> and the <em>plug-announce</em> lists the week of the
  meeting.

 <h1>Linux Advanced Topic Talk (LATT)</h1>

 <p>
  The advanced topic meeting has been a dream of Zot O'Connor and
  David Mandel for quite a while. The purpose is to have a meeting
  where we can dive deeply into the technical and
  theoretical details of a specific topic, without covering the basics.
 </p>

 <b>The meeting rules are:</b>
 <ol>
  <li>
   The speaker has 15 minutes or so to present the meat of his topic
   speech.  The audience is expected to maintain attentive and
   respectful silence and to let the speaker expound, jotting any
   questions for later. At the end of 15 to 20 minutes, the speaker
   should begin accepting questions, and be prepared to go off-script
   for the remainder of the talk.
  </li>

  <li>
   There are stupid questions.  The speaker (and the group) can deem
   a question too basic for this topic discussion, too off-topic, or
   just dumb.  This may seem rude, but the idea is to get right down
   into the details of technique and theory, expecting the audience to
   either already have the necessary foundation knowledge, or to be
   capable of jotting some notes and finding what they need during
   later self-directed library or Internet research.
   <p>
    For instance, given a talk on Cryptography, it can be expected
    that the room knows all about public/private key pairs.  The
    speaker should list topics you are expected to know before
    arriving.
   </p>
  </li>

  <li>
   There should be a lot of questions and feedback from the audience.
  </li>

  <li>
   All are invited, but be sure to know the talk is aimed at experts/advanced
   Linux persons (or those who <em>think</em> they're experts).
  </li>
  </li>
 </ol>
