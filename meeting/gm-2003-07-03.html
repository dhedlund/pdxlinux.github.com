   <p>
 The Open Source Development Lab (<a href="http://www.osdl.org">www.osdl.org</a>)
 is an industry sponsored lab with data centers in Portland, Oregon and
 Yokohama, Japan.  The lab sponsors key industry projects,
 including industry initiatives to enhance Linux for use in
 corporate data centers (Data Center Linux) and in
 telecommunications networks (Carrier Grade Linux).
 Timothy D. Witham is the lab's director.  He will give a
 general overview of the lab and it's activities and what
 it can offer to Open Source developers.  I suppose he
 will also talk about Linus Torvalds' decision to take a
 position with the lab.
