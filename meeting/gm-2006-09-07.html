   Inkscape is an Open Source vector graphics editor, with capabilities
   similar to Illustrator, Freehand, CorelDraw, or Xara X using the    
   W3C standard Scalable Vector Graphics  (SVG) file format. 
   Supported SVG features include shapes, paths, text, markers, 
   clones, alpha blending, transforms, gradients, patterns, and  
   grouping. Inkscape also supports Creative Commons meta-data, 
   node editing, layers, complex path operations, bitmap tracing, 
   text-on-path, flowed text, direct XML editing, and more. It imports 
   formats such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and others and exports PNG as  
   well as multiple vector-based formats.
</p><p>
   Inkscape's main goal is to create a powerful and convenient drawing 
   tool fully compliant with XML, SVG, and CSS standards. We also aim 
   to maintain a thriving user and developer community by using open, 
    community-oriented development process, and by making sure Inkcape 
   is easy to learn, to use, and to extend.
