   <a href="htpp://www.personaltelco.net">The Personal Telco Project</a> is 
   an all volunteer open source oriented organization that has been a leader 
   in bringing free wireless internet access to Portland for many years. 
   Personal Telco has brought free wireless access to Portland by working 
   with coffee shops, bars, and other businesses and individuals who are 
   willing to share their internet connections. Personal Telco predates 
   Portland's Metro-fi system by several years, and judging by Metro-fi's 
   difficulties it may postdate it as well.
